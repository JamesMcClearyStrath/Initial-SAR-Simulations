# Initial-SAR-Simulations

This contains the initial code used for simulations and learning how to calculate wave propagations. 

The 1D adn 2D wave propagation examples are based off code from https://hstephen.faculty.unlv.edu/teaching-2/cee-709/

The SAR code is some example code provided by mathworks at https://www.mathworks.com/help/radar/ug/stripmap-synthetic-aperture-radar-sar-image-formation.html

1D, 2D files can be run individually, Stripmap SAR code must have both helper functions in same folder


Currently working through examples of different radar tutorials, given by Mathworks for their Radar Toolbox - https://uk.mathworks.com/help/radar/examples.html?category=index&exampleproduct=all&s_tid=CRUX_lftnav
