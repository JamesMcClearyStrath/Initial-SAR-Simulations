Code developed to create Bistatic SAR propogation reusing the stripmap SAR code.

To run keep all files in same directory, Note that the helper functions are not required to run most of the code, only the final part of analysis.


Currently used to generate a reference and a surveillance waveform, though assumes a Tx with antennae and dish rather than an isotropic Tx.

Examples of processing are included though these assume its an active radar from a platform rather than using a Tx from separate location.

Bistatic processing will be included in next step.

non pulsed waveforms in theory should work with the propogation method though different processing would be implemented for this.

New file - Bistatic_SAR_Propogation_Model_Correlation

estimates range difference between L (Tx - Rx) and R (r1+r2 or Tx-Target-Rx). This is done with time difference of arrival.

Time difference calculated using complex correlation, with sample number used to get time difference then range. 

Tested for 1 target, developing multiple targets
