Code developed to create Bistatic SAR propogation reusing the stripmap SAR code.

Currently used to generate a reference and a surveillance waveform, though assumes a Tx with antennae and dish rather than an isotropic Tx.

Examples of processing are included though these assume its an active radar from a platform rather than using a Tx from separate location.

Bistatic processing will be included in next step.

non pulsed waveforms in theory should work with the propogation method though different processing would be implemented for this.
